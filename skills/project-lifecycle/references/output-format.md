# Output Format Policy — MD canonical, HTML opt-in companion

## Why this rule exists

Markdown is the default agent ↔ user format because it's cheap (token-light), diffable (audit-friendly), and machine-readable (subagent-consumed). But MD breaks down when:

- the artifact carries rich visuals (mockups, dataflow, side-by-side option grids)
- the audience is non-engineer / stakeholder / leadership
- the artifact is read once and shared widely

For those cases, HTML is a better human-facing format (per Thariq Shihipar's ["Using Claude Code: The unreasonable effectiveness of HTML"](https://claude.com/blog/using-claude-code-the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-html)). The cost: 2-4x generation time, more tokens, noisier diffs.

**Resolution**: MD stays canonical and source-of-truth for every artifact. HTML is an opt-in *companion view* generated at 3 specific delivery nodes, co-committed alongside the MD. The MD is never replaced.

## Force-MD artifact list (no opt-in, no exceptions)

These artifacts MUST stay markdown. The cost-benefit is already decided:

| Artifact | Why force-MD |
|---|---|
| `docs/brainstorming-qa-log.md` | append-only audit; diff is the audit trail; subagent reads on context recall |
| `iteration-journal.md` | append-only per-task audit; diff is the audit trail; AI reads every session start |
| `RESUME.md` | AI reads on every session start; diff drives "what changed" understanding |
| `docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-mX.Y-resume-note.md` | one-shot consumption by next AI session |
| `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-phase-N-<slug>.md` | implementer + reviewer subagents read N times; token cost compounds |
| `docs/handoff/YYYY-MM-DD-phase-X.Y-handoff.md` | body is a checklist + structured report; visuals add no value; AI reads for context |
| PR description (GitHub body) | GitHub does not render HTML in PR body — HTML escapes to noise. MD is the only valid format. Rich companions ship as separate HTML artifact + link. |
| backlog files | append-only deferred-decision log; diff matters |
| `CONTEXT.md` / `CONTEXT-MAP.md` | AI reads every session for vocabulary alignment; diff is the glossary audit trail; never visual |
| `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md` | sequential audit log; reviewers grep + read in plain text; visuals add no value |
| `docs/superpowers/specs/*-prd.md` | implementer / stakeholder reads; user-story list works in MD; subagent-consumed |

**Red flag**: any of these rendered as HTML → revert immediately.

## HTML opt-in nodes (2 places, with re-opt-in for spec/design)

The skill asks the user once per node (unless `html-policy` is set):

### Node 1. Spec/design doc — opt-in at brainstorm exploration; re-opt-in at spec finalization

This is one artifact (`docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-phase-N-<slug>-design.html`) with two trigger timings:

**1a. At brainstorm exploration** (SKILL.md step 1) — when `superpowers:brainstorming` produces parallel design options (mockups, dataflow comparisons, side-by-side option grids), prompt:

> Generate HTML companion for design exploration? (2-4x time, richer visuals + shareable link; MD design doc remains source of truth)

If yes: generate `…-design.html` alongside the MD. **Use the structural pattern + reusable skeleton in `references/html-companion-template.md` + `references/html-companion-skeleton.html`** — these capture the mandatory section list (customer voice / stakeholder lens / side-by-side comparison / mockup / state machine / decisions + disagreements / phase timeline / glossary / inline-clickable citations) and the shared CSS token palette so every project's HTML companion looks consistent.

**1b. At spec finalization (re-opt-in)** (SKILL.md step 4) — if user declined at 1a but now wants stakeholder-ready locked spec, re-ask:

> Generate HTML stakeholder view of locked spec? (renders mockups + dataflow + evidence-strength tags)

If yes: regenerate the same `…-design.html` from the now-locked MD using the template in `references/html-companion-template.md`. If already accepted at 1a, skip — the file already exists and can be refreshed in-place by a normal regen prompt.

The two timings exist because exploration HTML may be wasted if spec drifts during revision pass. User may prefer to wait until lock-in.

### Node 2. Milestone-done summary

At milestone close, prompt:

> Generate HTML milestone summary report? (rendered journal timeline + stakeholder-ready visuals + SVG diagrams of what shipped; MD canonical artifacts unchanged)

If yes: generate `docs/milestone-summary/YYYY-MM-DD-mX-summary.html`. Pulls from iteration-journal, handoff docs, smoke results. Renders timeline, key decisions, evidence-strength rollup, "what works now" feature list. Reuse the CSS token palette + badge taxonomy + footer pattern from `references/html-companion-template.md` so milestone summaries look consistent with spec/design companions.

**Note**: this is where iteration-journal becomes visual. The journal MD itself is force-MD (audit/diff-critical), but the milestone summary renders a timeline VIEW of the journal entries. No journal HTML file exists separately.

## Project-level overrides via `CLAUDE.md`

To avoid repeating the question every phase, set policy keys in project root `CLAUDE.md`:

```
html-policy: ask | always-md | always-html
smoke-mode: ask | self | guided
domain-docs: ./CONTEXT.md          # or ./CONTEXT-MAP.md for multi-context repos
comprehension: off | lite | full
close-gate: per-task | pr-boundary
archetype: auto | builder | prototyper | sweeper | grower | maintainer | off
```

Defaults:
- `html-policy` = `ask` (skill prompts at each opt-in node)
- `smoke-mode` = `ask` (skill prompts at smoke kickoff)
- `domain-docs` = unset (skill discovers `CONTEXT.md` / `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at repo root if present; explicit pointer beats auto-discovery for multi-context or non-root layouts)
- `comprehension` = `off` (anti-cognitive-offloading co-discovery round is opt-in; see `comprehension-co-discovery.md`)
- `close-gate` = `per-task` (where the human-blocking close approval sits; see `close-gate.md` §"Approval timing")
- `archetype` = `auto` (intent-gate infers the work's archetype per request + one-tap confirm; reshapes the chain Size routed into; see `intent-gate.md` §"Archetype")

Values:
- `html-policy: always-md` → skip all HTML opt-in questions; force MD everywhere
- `html-policy: always-html` → auto-generate HTML companion at all 3 nodes; no question
- `smoke-mode: self` → AI gives handoff §4 path and waits for findings report
- `smoke-mode: guided` → AI walks user through each smoke stage step by step (recommended default for solo-developer projects)
- `comprehension: lite` → run the COMPREHEND co-discovery round once per phase (the MVP — `cadence.md` §"Comprehension Co-Discovery"); one *why*-question on the validated diff, discovery framing, non-blocking, no scoreboard, <30s
- `comprehension: full` → accepted as a synonym of `lite`; the COMPREHEND round runs once per phase either way.
- `archetype: <name>` → pins a default archetype for a repo whose work is overwhelmingly one kind (e.g. a mature service → `maintainer`); still per-request overridable. `archetype: off` → always Builder baseline (full backward-compat, no archetype reshaping). The `auto` default infers + one-tap-confirms per request, which is also the guard against archetype freezing into a fixed box. See `intent-gate.md` §"Archetype"
- `close-gate: pr-boundary` → the per-task human-blocking approval is delegated to an independent read-only reviewer subagent; Task Close Reports are still written every task (audit trail, non-blocking); the human's blocking approval happens once per PR/merge, which MUST keep a human-written approval marker the AI cannot author (the self-certification hole stays closed). Deterministic `task-done`/`phase-done` gates are unchanged in both modes. Treat the flip as an experiment (catch parity + comprehension drift over 2-3 tracks; rollback = flip the key back). Full mechanics + attack surface in `close-gate.md` §"Approval timing"

## Smoke interaction modes (Mode A vs Mode B)

At step 8 (PR + Track A smoke), AI asks unless `smoke-mode` overrides:

> Track A smoke mode? (A) Self-serve — I give you the checklist path, you run it alone and report findings back, or (B) Guided — I walk you through each stage step-by-step, you report per-stage.

### Mode A (self-serve)
- AI surfaces handoff doc §4 path
- User runs Track A alone in their own time
- User pings AI with consolidated findings list
- AI triages S1/S2/S3 and proceeds

### Mode B (guided, recommended)
- AI presents smoke stage 1, waits for user result
- User confirms pass or reports finding
- AI logs finding (if any), moves to stage 2
- Repeat until all stages done
- Better for catching mid-flow issues + interactive triage

Both modes still produce the same `docs/smoke-findings.md` artifact. Mode B just delivers it interactively.

## HTML generation guidance (when opt-in fires)

When AI generates an HTML companion:

- **Use `frontend-design:frontend-design` skill** for design-system consistency if available
- **Inline CSS / minimal external deps** — companion must work as a single self-contained file, openable in a browser locally (`open file.html`) or uploaded to S3
- **Mobile-responsive** — stakeholders may view on phone
- **Render SVG inline** for diagrams (not external images)
- **Include "Copy as prompt"-style buttons** for any interactive element that should feed back into Claude (per Shihipar's two-way interaction pattern), e.g., copy summary as prompt for the next session
- **Co-commit with MD** — both files in the same commit, MD listed first
- **Never delete or skip the MD** — HTML is companion, not replacement

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why bad |
|---|---|
| Rendering qa-log / journal / RESUME as HTML | Audit trail dies; diffs become unreadable |
| Plan as HTML | Subagent token cost × N dispatches |
| Inline HTML in PR description | GitHub escapes it; reviewer sees noise |
| Asking "MD or HTML?" for every artifact every phase | Decision fatigue; defeats the policy |
| Generating HTML companion without asking | Steals user time/tokens; violates opt-in contract |
| Skipping the MD because "HTML is better" | Source-of-truth fragmentation; audit dies |
| Setting `html-policy: always-html` then complaining about token cost | User chose the tradeoff |

## Origin

This policy was crystallized after reviewing Shihipar's HTML manifesto (May 2026) against the project-lifecycle skill's existing artifact set. Conclusion: HTML wins for human-facing rich visuals, but the skill's audit/diff/subagent-cost architecture means most artifacts must stay MD. The 2 opt-in nodes (spec/design + milestone summary) are exactly where HTML's payoff (visual exploration + stakeholder shareability) clears the cost bar. Spec/design has two trigger timings (exploration vs finalization) because exploration HTML can be wasted if spec drifts; users decide which timing suits them.

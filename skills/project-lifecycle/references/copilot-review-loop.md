# Copilot review loop (per-PR)

Every PR — stacked or not — passes through a `@copilot review` loop on top of CI before merge. The loop guarantees a fresh independent reviewer scans the diff with full file context, and that **every finding is either fixed (with a visible audit trail) or explicitly deferred (with a reason in the same thread)**.

## Loop steps

```dot
digraph copilot_loop {
  "Open PR + body from handoff" [shape=box];
  "CI green?" [shape=diamond];
  "Fix CI" [shape=box];
  "Comment @copilot review on PR" [shape=box];
  "Wait for Copilot review (~1-3 min)" [shape=box];
  "Any findings?" [shape=diamond];
  "Fix each finding in a fixup commit" [shape=box];
  "Reply per inline comment with fix SHA + summary" [shape=box];
  "All findings addressed?" [shape=diamond];
  "Comment @copilot review again" [shape=box];
  "Smoke (Track A) + merge" [shape=doublecircle];

  "Open PR + body from handoff" -> "CI green?";
  "CI green?" -> "Fix CI" [label="no"];
  "Fix CI" -> "CI green?";
  "CI green?" -> "Comment @copilot review on PR" [label="yes"];
  "Comment @copilot review on PR" -> "Wait for Copilot review (~1-3 min)";
  "Wait for Copilot review (~1-3 min)" -> "Any findings?";
  "Any findings?" -> "Smoke (Track A) + merge" [label="no — clean"];
  "Any findings?" -> "Fix each finding in a fixup commit" [label="yes"];
  "Fix each finding in a fixup commit" -> "Reply per inline comment with fix SHA + summary";
  "Reply per inline comment with fix SHA + summary" -> "All findings addressed?";
  "All findings addressed?" -> "Fix each finding in a fixup commit" [label="no"];
  "All findings addressed?" -> "Comment @copilot review again" [label="yes"];
  "Comment @copilot review again" -> "Wait for Copilot review (~1-3 min)";
}
```

## Trigger format

### Default — directive prompt (RECOMMENDED)

Empirically, a bare `@copilot review` sometimes returns silently (Copilot "finished work" with no public review comment and no inline findings). A **directive prompt** that lists specific audit points consistently produces a substantive response — Copilot replies point-by-point with `file:line` references, raises actionable gaps, and may even push a fix commit when the gap is mechanical.

Template:

```
@copilot review

Please specifically audit:

1. <module / function / behavior to verify> at <file path / line range> — <what would be wrong if it's wrong>.
2. <next audit point with the same shape>
...

Report findings inline on the relevant lines. If nothing actionable, state that explicitly so we can merge with confidence.
```

Aim for 4-8 audit points covering: the new module's core invariant, every cross-cutting concern (atomicity / cycle / race), every CONTESTED design decision from the brainstorm, every locked-but-flagged risk in the spec, any test that "looks right" but might be tautological. The last sentence ("state explicitly if nothing actionable") matters — without it Copilot may stay silent on a clean PR and you can't tell silent-clean from silent-failed.

### Bare trigger — fallback only

```
@copilot review
```

Use only when the PR is so small that a directive prompt would be cargo-cult (1-line typo fix, mechanical rename). Body must be exactly the trigger; no other prose — Copilot's parser is conservative about preamble.

## Fixup commit conventions

- **One fixup commit per Copilot review round** (not per finding). Commit message: `fix(<scope>): address GitHub Copilot review findings on PR #<N> (<summary>)`. Body lists `Fx -` rows mapping each finding to the change.
- **Never amend or squash the fixup history.** Copilot will re-read at the next `@copilot review`; reviewers will see the round-by-round arc.
- **Add regression tests for any CRITICAL / production-broken finding** in the same commit. Unit tests that passed because the bug was masked by an injected fake are blind spots — the test must exercise the production default.

## Per-finding inline reply format

After the fixup commit is pushed, reply to **every** Copilot inline comment (no exceptions, including the ones graded "low confidence"). The reply lives in the same comment thread so future readers + the next `@copilot review` see the audit trail.

**Fixed:**
```
Fixed in `<short SHA>` (Fx). <one-sentence summary of what changed and why>.
```

**Deferred:**
```
**Deferred** (`<short SHA>` Fx). <reason>. <tracking link or "tracked as backlog item">.
```

`Fx` is the row-label from the fixup commit body. Always link both the SHA and the row so the reader can jump from comment → commit body → diff.

### Why reply per finding (not a summary PR comment)

- Copilot threads each finding individually; a top-level PR comment doesn't dismiss the inline thread, so the next review round sees them as "open."
- User scanning the PR sees the fix inline with the original concern. No mental cross-reference between a summary table and a diff.
- The `in_reply_to` API call (`POST /repos/{o}/{r}/pulls/{n}/comments/{cid}/replies`) costs ~1 second per finding — total under a minute for a typical 8-12 finding review.

## Looping rule

Re-trigger `@copilot review` after every fixup-commit round, no matter how small. Two practical reasons:

1. **Fix introduced a new finding** — common when fixing a Zod schema gap or renaming a field; downstream callers may not have been migrated.
2. **Copilot graded the fix** — even a "still has a minor concern" follow-up is signal the user should see before merge.

Stop the loop only when Copilot's response is either explicitly "no actionable issues" OR the user signs off on remaining items (deferred with reason in-thread).

## When to skip the loop

| Situation | Skip? |
|---|---|
| Pure docs-only PR (no `.ts` / `.py` / `.go` etc.) | OK to skip; flag in PR body |
| Trivial 1-line fix that doesn't touch security / state / DB | OK to skip; flag in PR body |
| User explicitly says "merge it, skip Copilot" | OK to skip; record reason in PR body |
| GitHub Actions billing-paused (Copilot's runner blocked) — 1st pass completed | **Run 1st-pass loop fully + use independent `code-reviewer` subagent as 2nd-pass stand-in** — see `ci-cd-gates.md` §Pattern E + below |
| GitHub Actions billing-paused — 1st pass also failed to spawn (Copilot reviewed: 0 findings) | Default path is NOT skipped — it failed. Dispatch **two sequential `code-reviewer` subagent passes** (one as initial reviewer, one as 2nd-pass to confirm clean). Record in the PR-comment evidence that Copilot reviewed 0 findings due to the billing block. |
| Phase delivery PR (any non-trivial feature) | **MANDATORY — never skip** |
| Stacked PR where base is a feature branch | **MANDATORY — same as standalone** |

## Copilot stand-in when billing-blocked

GitHub Actions billing-paused (`The job was not started because recent GitHub Actions payments have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased`) also blocks Copilot's review job because Copilot runs on Actions infrastructure. Typical failure mode: the **first** `@copilot review` returns inline findings (the job had already spun up before billing hit), but every **subsequent** `@copilot review` errors out silently — leaving the loop stuck "waiting for round 2".

When that happens:

1. **Treat the 1st-pass findings as the standard 1st round.** Address every inline comment per the per-finding-reply protocol above. Fixup commits with `Fx-NN` labels. Re-trigger `@copilot review` once to confirm billing is still blocked (don't assume — sometimes it intermittently works).
2. **Dispatch an independent `code-reviewer` subagent as the 2nd-pass stand-in.** Brief it with:
    > "Copilot's 2nd pass is blocked by external infra (GitHub Actions billing). You are the independent 2nd reviewer for fixup commit `<sha>` on PR #<N>. Verify each Fx label actually addresses its 1st-round Copilot finding correctly, AND spot-check for regressions the fixup might have introduced (type safety / immutability / new dead code / test coverage gaps). Report CRITICAL / IMPORTANT / MINOR / NIT with file:line."
3. **Apply that subagent's findings** before merging — same standard as Copilot's findings would have been. Per-finding reply not strictly required (no Copilot thread to reply *to*), but record what was fixed + which SHA in the PR body or in the journal.
4. **In the PR body**, note the stand-in arrangement:
   > Copilot 2nd-pass blocked by Actions billing. Independent `code-reviewer` subagent stood in — found `<N>` IMPORTANT items, resolved in `<sha>`. See the journal entry for this phase for full list.
5. **Loop the stand-in TWICE max** — once to surface findings, once to confirm the fixup is clean. Pass 1 = independent review against the fixup commit; pass 2 = re-loop the same prompt against the latest HEAD to confirm "APPROVED-CLEAN, no new findings". If pass 2 surfaces something, fix + commit and dispatch a fresh pass-2 attempt; if the loop fails to close in 3 fixup cycles, surface to the user — likely a design-level issue the stand-in is gesturing at.

The PR can merge once the stand-in's pass 2 returns APPROVED-CLEAN AND the local test-evidence comment is posted on the PR (per `ci-cd-gates.md` §"Posting test evidence"). The Copilot loop closure rule ("clean OR user signs off") is satisfied because (a) 1st-pass findings are all addressed + (b) the independent reviewer signed off in pass 2 (the equivalent of Copilot's "no actionable issues" re-trigger reply).

**Merge-readiness statement to include in the PR-comment evidence** (matches the format in `ci-cd-gates.md` §"Posting test evidence"): `Ready for merge: stand-in pass 1 → N findings → resolved in <SHA>; pass 2 → APPROVED-CLEAN; R5 green.`

## Stacked PR caveat

If the PR is stacked on another feature branch (base != `main`), Copilot reviews the **head-vs-base** diff, which is exactly what you want — it focuses on the new commits, not on the inherited base.

After base merges and the PR auto-retargets to `main`, **do not re-trigger** unless new commits land — the diff content is identical, only the base ref changed.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Triggering `@copilot review` before CI runs → Copilot can't see green CI; doesn't change findings but signals churn.
- ❌ Replying with "fixed" but without the SHA or the Fx label → next round of `@copilot review` re-flags the same issue because the thread looks unresolved.
- ❌ Amending the fixup commit after Copilot reads it → review thread points at a dead SHA.
- ❌ Marking a finding "won't fix" without a deferred-reason reply → reviewer can't tell if it was intentional or missed.
- ❌ Skipping the loop on a stacked PR because "Copilot already reviewed the parent" — stacked PRs add NEW commits that the parent review never saw.
- ❌ Using the bare `@copilot review` trigger on a non-trivial PR — Copilot may finish silently with no public response. Use a directive prompt (see Trigger format) so silent-clean is distinguishable from silent-failed.
- ❌ Fabricating SHAs in per-finding replies — always paste a real `git log --oneline -1` SHA. Wrong SHAs leave the audit trail pointing at nothing and reviewers can't follow up.

## Tool / API reference

```bash
# Trigger review
gh pr comment <N> --body "@copilot review"

# List inline review comments (id / path / line / body)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<N>/comments --jq '.[] | {id, path, line, body: .body[0:200]}'

# Reply to a specific inline comment
gh api -X POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<N>/comments/<cid>/replies -f body="Fixed in \`<sha>\` (Fx). <summary>."

# Confirm Copilot's latest formal review (state / commit oid / submittedAt)
gh pr view <N> --json reviews --jq '.reviews | map({state, author: .author.login, submittedAt, commit: .commit.oid})'

# List Copilot's top-level PR comments (used when Copilot replies without a formal review object)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<N>/comments --jq '.[] | select(.user.login=="Copilot") | {created_at, body: .body[0:300]}'
```

## After triggering — actually wait + check

**The single biggest bug in running this loop is "fire and forget."** Copilot takes 1-3 minutes to respond; if you trigger and immediately move on, you forget to come back, the user thinks the loop closed silently, and the next phase starts on top of unreviewed work. **You MUST poll for the response and confirm-or-fix before moving on.**

Use a background `until` loop that exits as soon as Copilot's comment is detected, then act on the result:

```bash
# Filter by created_at > <trigger time> to ignore prior Copilot comments
# in the same thread. Tune the timestamp to seconds after you triggered.
TRIGGER_TS="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
until [[ $(gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<N>/comments \
    --jq "[.[] | select(.user.login==\"Copilot\" and (.created_at > \"$TRIGGER_TS\"))] | length") -gt 0 ]]; do
  sleep 30
done
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<N>/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login=="Copilot")] | last | .body'
```

Run that as a background bash command (with `run_in_background: true`). The harness fires a notification the moment the loop exits — you act on Copilot's response in the same conversation turn, not later.

Why a TIMESTAMP filter instead of polling for ANY Copilot comment: on PRs with multiple round-trips, you'll trigger the same loop body 3+ times; without a timestamp filter the second `until` exits instantly because the FIRST round's comment is still there. Always filter by `created_at > <trigger time>`.

Why `state == "completed"` events alone are insufficient: Copilot sometimes "finishes work" without posting a comment (see the bare-trigger anti-pattern above). Watch for the COMMENT, not the EVENT.

## Findings audit row in handoff doc

After the loop closes, the handoff doc's §6 "Findings + known limits" section gains a row tagged `Copilot review (N findings, all addressed)` so the post-merge audit shows the loop ran.

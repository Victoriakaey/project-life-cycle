## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Adds native support for Codex, Qoder, CodeBuddy, and Antigravity, alongside Claude Code.
- Splits the README into a short landing page plus a full guide carrying the complete workflow narrative and repository map.

### Changed

- Relicenses from MIT to PolyForm Perimeter 1.0.1 (more restrictive than MIT — review the new terms if you redistribute).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- Internal tooling; no user-facing change.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Adds an "archetype" classification (Builder / Prototyper / Sweeper / Grower / Maintainer) that shapes which review steps and quality checks a request goes through.
- For cleanup-only work, requires the change to actually shrink the codebase, or an explicit documented reason why not.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Adds an opt-in percentage-based trigger for the context floor, for models with much larger context windows.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Fixes the context-floor block message to show a percentage that matches what your own status line reports, instead of only raw token counts.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- Adds a hard context-usage floor: past a configurable threshold, edits are blocked until you checkpoint your progress, closing the gap left by softer warnings.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Adds an unattended ("AFK") run mode with a required goal/stop/budget/report contract, a budget circuit-breaker, and an exit report — merging always stays a human action.

### Fixed

- Fixes enforcement hooks that silently failed to load under a plugin install, caused by an incorrect file path.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- Extends the hard-bug diagnosis workflow to check past lessons first and record a new one afterward, so the same root cause isn't re-discovered from scratch next time.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Adds a structured, auditable review record for AI code review: fresh context, read-only tools, evidence quoted per finding, and a verdict computed last rather than self-declared.
- Adds a coverage check confirming every commit since the last review round is actually covered before merge.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Adds a `close-gate` policy for choosing where human approval happens — every task, or once per pull request with an independent review filling the gap in between.
- Adds `/builder-profile`, a command that reads your own local session history and reports back how you actually use the coding agent — entirely local, nothing uploaded.
- Adds a rolling-archive pattern so a project's status file stays a manageable size instead of growing forever.

### Fixed

- Fixes a safety-guard false positive that blocked commits whose *message* merely mentioned `main` or `--no-verify`, rather than commands that actually did either.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Ships enforcement hooks: one blocks bypassing commit/push safety checks and direct pushes to the main branch, another reminds you to close out a phase properly.
- Adds an opt-in check that asks one reflection question about your own change after it ships, without keeping a running score.

### Changed

- Every pull request now opens with a short plain-language summary before the technical detail.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Adds `/init-harness`, which bootstraps a new or existing project with this plugin's conventions and starter documentation in one pass.
- Adds `/release`, which computes the version bump from the changelog, tags, and publishes a release automatically.
- Adds onboarding and verify-loop guides for bringing a new contributor (human or AI) up to speed safely.

### Changed

- The per-task validator now runs a lie-detection pass first, checking a builder's claims against the real diff before accepting them.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Adds a mandatory user-story and acceptance-criteria file for user-facing work, checked by a new independent acceptance-verifier step.
- Adds `/ship`, a command that runs one feature end-to-end (research, story, spec, build, verify, PR) with a few points where you confirm before continuing.
- Adds quality rules for optional HTML companion documents (accessibility, real data instead of placeholders, consistent styling).

### Changed

- Expands the per-task review cadence from 5 to 6 steps, adding the acceptance-verifier and a stricter, read-only validator.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-11

Initial release.

### Added

- Introduces the full spec → plan → execute → journal → milestone-done project workflow, plus a per-task cadence of implement → review → code-quality review → fix → journal.
- Adds a research protocol for locking design decisions, backed by a second, independent reviewer check.
- Adds Architectural Decision Records, a domain glossary convention, and delivery templates (issue breakdown, changelog, PR body).

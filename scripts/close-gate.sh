#!/usr/bin/env bash
# close-gate.sh — deterministic wrap-up gate for THIS repo (project-life-cycle).
#
# Usage: close-gate.sh phase X.Y
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT the canonical gate from references/close-gate.md:
# This repo gitignores all of docs/ (a local .git/hooks/pre-push check BLOCKS any
# tracked docs/ file — publishing this repo must never ship internal working docs). The
# canonical gate proves the journal / spec / plan / ROADMAP ceremony via git commit-range
# checks (git diff origin/main..HEAD), which structurally CANNOT see gitignored files. So the
# two designs are mutually exclusive here. This gate proves the same ceremony via LOCAL FILE
# signals (existence + FACT content + freshness-vs-branch-point) instead — the only observable
# evidence for docs that never enter git. Tracked artifacts (CHANGELOG.md, the feat/fix
# commit, the test-evidence file) are still checked via git / file as normal.
#
# Envelope: bash + git + jq + coreutils only. NO python3 (a hard rule for this gate — the
# gate must stay a drop-in with a minimal dependency footprint).

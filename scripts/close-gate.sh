# close-gate.sh — deterministic wrap-up gate for THIS repo (project-life-cycle).

# Usage: close-gate.sh task X.Y     (per-commit subset — run by the pre-push hook)

#
# WHY THIS IS NOT the canonical gate from references/close-gate.md:
# This repo gitignores all of docs/ (a local .git/hooks/pre-push check BLOCKS any
# tracked docs/ file — publishing this repo must never ship internal working docs). The
# canonical gate proves the journal / spec / plan / ROADMAP ceremony via git commit-range
# checks (git diff origin/main..HEAD), which structurally CANNOT see gitignored files. So the
# two designs are mutually exclusive here. This gate proves the same ceremony via LOCAL FILE
# signals (existence + FACT content + freshness-vs-branch-point) instead — the only observable
# evidence for docs that never enter git. Tracked artifacts (CHANGELOG.md, the feat/fix
# commit, the test-evidence file) are still checked via git / file as normal.
#
# Envelope: bash + git + jq + coreutils only. NO python3 (a hard rule for this gate — the
# gate must stay a drop-in with a minimal dependency footprint).

# validate.py reads the plugin manifests, skills/*/SKILL.md frontmatter + referenced files,
# the commands manifest + commands/*.md, and every TRACKED *.md (check 9). It reads no .sh,
# no test file, nothing untracked — so none of those appear here.
#
# The tracked-only surface is load-bearing. Check 9 used to WALK the filesystem: orders of magnitude more .md on
# this repo than are tracked (another tool's cache, the gitignored docs/ tree). No content
# check over inputs nearly all invisible to git can be honest; validate.py was narrowed to tracked
# files (md_files_to_check) so this fingerprint means exactly what it says.

#     `planned` row in a real roadmap already names a phase that has not started, so a
#     content-only check greens before the work exists. (Regression: the first version of

#     message still pointed at a fresh() call that no longer ran.)

# (a) an id ending a sentence (`... see N57.`) does NOT match, because `.` is excluded on

#    value, or an entry that isn't an object / is missing its name/command, is a ✗ — never
#    a silent skip that would let a broken invariant slip by. Every jq read is guarded with
#    a sentinel fallback so a bad SHAPE produces a graceful ✗ row, not a raw jq trace + a
#    `set -e` abort that truncates the remaining invariants (the crash-under-set-e lesson
#    already learned in scripts/invariants/manifest-version-sync.sh, earlier commits).
